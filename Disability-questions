   1. How would you categorize your disability?
    -> Physical Disability
    -> Intellectual Disability
    -> Cognitive Disability
    -> Psychiatric Disability

We often learn a lot from our friends and peers. Disable children often report that they were socially segregated from other children, either directly because they are moved into different classes or different schools, or because other students avoided them. Which is why, disable children usually find it difficult to forge relationships with others, be it friendship or romantic relationships.

   2. Do you find it difficult to make friends?
    -> Yes
    -> No

   3. If yes to the above question, why do you think so?
    -> Inability to participate in activities that are important to others
    -> Or does it arise from the (perceived) need on the part of the person with a disability for technological or human assistance to manage typical life tasks?
    -> Does it stem from a belief that the person with a disability does not possess the social or psychological resources to prove a stimulating and rewarding friend?

I just wanted to share an article I read. change.org is a platform that bring around change by signing petitions. One such petition is described in the link below:
